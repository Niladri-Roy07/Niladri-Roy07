Exercise 1: Calculate the Multiplication and Sum of Two Numbers
n1 =10;
n2 =20;
n3 = n1 + n2;
n4 = n1 * n2;
print("The addition of two numbers:",n3);
print("The multiplication of two numbers:",n4);

Exercise 2: Print the Sum of a Current Number and a Previous Number.
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]  # the input numbers
prev_index = 0              # index of previous number
curr_index = 1              # index of current number
sum = numbers[prev_index] + numbers[curr_index]  # correct way to get the sum
print("The sum of the numbers:", sum);

Exercise 3: Print Characters Present at an Even Index Number
text ="Hello World"; # input character
even_index=text[::2]; #the index of the character
print("The even index:", even_index);

Exercise 4: Remove First n Characters from a String
str = "HelloWorld"; #input string
index=3;  #the index of the string
remove_index=str[index::];  #the removed index of the string
print("Remove the index:", remove_index);

Exercise 5: Check if the First and Last Numbers of a List are the Same
Numbers=[10,20,30,40]; #the input numbers
n1=0; #the first index
n3=3; #the second index
if n1==n3:
        print("The numbers are same:");
else:
    print("The numbers are not same:");

Exercise 6: Display Numbers Divisible by 5
n = int(input("Enter a number:"));
if n % 5 == 0:
    print("The number is divisible by five.");
else:
    print("The number is not divisible by five.");

Exercise 7: Find the Number of Occurrences of a Substring in a String
text = "Python I am doing now and I am enjoying it too";
substring = "Python";

count = text.count(substring);
print("The number of occurrences of the substring:", count);
